# Uses OpenCore bootloader

With these EFI folders I ran Catalina and Big Sur Beta flawlessly on the configuration above. B450M DS3H is a popular MoBo, so I decided to help those with a similar configuration ðŸ˜€ I bought a MacBook Air 11' in 2016 and it still rocks, but I need serious horsepower and storage for dev work, so nothing beats a hackintosh in bang4buck, especially a Ryzen one!

# Mentions
If the drive icons and Apple logo look really big at boot time, select the NVRAM option once, then you're set (unless you have a 4K display, then you'll need to dig into the config.plist, but there are plenty of tutorials online ðŸ˜‰)
