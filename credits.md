# Credits

## These amazing people made this guide possible:

\(In no particular order\)

* _CorpNewt_ - He taught me how to hackintosh in the first place, so I wouldn't be here without him.  He also let me use parts of his Intel Vanilla guide, such as the **Kexts** or the **Config.plist Basics** page. The layout and explanations of the example configs are also based on his guide.
* _Notiflux_ - He showed me the light of vanilla in the darkness of distro's, or less poetically said he showed me that you do not in fact **have** to use a distro for AMD machines. Lots of this guide was based on knowledge I had learned from him.
* _Algrey and Ydeng -_ These are the folks who have come up with the patches needed for native audio on Ryzen.
* _Toleda_ - He also worked on the basis behind the native audio for Ryzen
* _Shaneee -_ For putting in his time and effort in to creating an AMD kernel for macOS.
* _Apple_ - For making macOS in the first place.
* _The Clover team -_ For creating Clover.
* _Download-Fritz -_ For awaking my competitive side, wanting to publish my guide before his idea.
* _Jadzia -_ For giving me a ZIP with the kexts needed for 10.13.6.
* _AlexTheGreat4000 -_ Some master bugcatching
* _DhinakG_ - For updating this guide to Mojave
* **You** - For reading the guide!

If you for some reason need to contact me personally, I am available on discord with the tag `@NoOne#8086`. I am more likely to answer a hackintosh question if you ask it in either the r/hackintosh discord or the AMD OS X discord.
